# ydc-voting-app
Description: A website that allows voters who have an account to vote on various elections. We are using the 2024 election as our example. The motivation behind this website was the dreaded long lines and the mandatory interruption of your day to go vote. We wanted to ease the traffic most buildings face when hosting elections and make voting more efficent, so someone with a busy schedule can open their phone cast their vote and move on with their day instead of having to drive 15 minutes to their voting location just to wait in line for 30 more minutes. 

Usage: login in to an account or sign up for an account then vote on the candidate that you wish to win.
